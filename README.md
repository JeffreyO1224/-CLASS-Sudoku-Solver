Hello! Thank you for visiting.
The following files are a part of a project for my Software Analysis and Design II course at Hunter College (CSCI 235).
This program used C++ to recursively-backtrack a two-dimensional array representing a sudoku board to efficiently find a solution to potentially thousands of sudoku puzzles. 

Above each function is a description for its parameters, pre-conditions, return values, and what it will accomplish (post) if applicable. Additionally, there are comments within several functions that will describe my thought process as I worked on this project. 

There are five files: 
- SudokuSolver.hpp, which is the header file containing the design of the sudoku solver
- SudokuSolver.cpp, which is the file containing the implementation of the design laid out by SudokuSolver.hpp
- puzzle1.csv, which contains an example sudoku puzzle
- main.cpp, which contains several lines of code I used in order to test the program
- MakeFile, which compiles all the files appropriately

If you have any questions about this project, feel free to email me at the email listed at the start of this. Thank you!
